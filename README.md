# Hostel-Administration-Program-Bennett-edorm-
A C++ program utilizes a Binary Search Tree for efficient hostel administration. Students can autonomously allot rooms, specifying preferences for roommates and accessing additional features. Administrators have comprehensive access to all information within the system.
This project introduces an innovative Hostel Administration Program, named Bennett-e-Dorm, designed to optimize, and streamline the student accommodation process. With a dual-login system catering to both students and administrators, the platform offers an efficient solution for room allocation and complaint management within educational institutions.

The student portal enables students to autonomously select their rooms based on their home state, fostering a sense of community by pairing students from the same region. Additionally, students can raise and track accommodation-related complaints through the system, ensuring prompt resolution and a conducive living environment.

On the administrator side, Bennett-e-Dorm provides tools to oversee room allocation and manage student complaints effectively. Administrators can view room assignments, ensuring cohesive living arrangements for students from the same state. The system enhances transparency and communication, facilitating a seamless administrative process.

The registration process for students involves providing essential details, and the system prevents duplicate enrolments, ensuring accurate and reliable data. Moreover, the program incorporates a gender-based room allocation feature, aligning accommodations with individual preferences and creating a comfortable living space for all.

Bennett-e-Dorm aims to revolutionize hostel administration by combining state-of-the-art technology with user-friendly interfaces, ultimately improving the overall student living experience. This abstract provides a glimpse into the features and functionalities that make Bennett -e-Dorm a valuable tool for efficient hostel management.
